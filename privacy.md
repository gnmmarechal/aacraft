### Privacy Policy

#### What personal data we collect and why we collect it

This software does NOT log any identifying user data, nor does it send any such data to anyone.
It can access identifying API tokens IF you configure it as such, for the sole purpose of running in modes such as Discord bot mode (with Discord giving you an API key that you will use to use this calculator as a bot).

Any updates to the software that change this behaviour WILL be announced, you WILL have the option to opt out of it and no data will be collected without your knowledge.
