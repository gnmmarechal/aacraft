## ArcheAge Crafting Calculator

A temporary website for my ArcheAge Crafting calculator project, because Microsoft is having issues resolving [my website](https://gs2012.xyz) and therefore failing the application certification process.

### Latest Update: 17/10/2022 (v.0.20.0.71)

- Introduced a labour calculator (including support for labour usage reduction with higher proficiency).
- Added a profit/labour measure.

### Basic Features
